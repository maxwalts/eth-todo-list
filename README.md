# Summary
A decentralized todo list web app. No react is used on the fontend, which is a relatively new thing for me. Code initally follows very closely to the course (with personal comments added), but I add my own features after basic functionality is established. jquery is used to get the bootstrap css remotely and keep the app updated with the latest information from the blockchain.

# Motivation
I did this as a first decentralized app (DAPP) so I can add a frontend interface to future smart contracts I write.
